		Good day to you Fawzy,</p>

<p id="thuhai"> I was a bit surprised to receive your message via Linkedin. On the whole, I understand your goodwill from the viewpoint of a business owner. I truly appreciate your interest in our app and our team. 

However, it's a pity that we cannot go ahead with this cooperation request as we cannot fulfil all your requirements. We do not want to make a false promise of resolving all the bugs and issues within your time frame in the future due to the lack of human resources and time zone difference. Moreover, it is not possible for us to provide you additional features in a fixed timeline as additional features take time to be built and even much more time for careful testing.</p>

<p class="domau"> I believe you could see our effort when the whole team stayed up until 2AM to sort things out. We treasure your success more than any profit we could take. That's why we recommended the suitable apps for you in the previous emails.</p>

<p class="domau">On behalf of our team, I really appreciate all the learnings and experiences we have got together in the past 3 weeks and really regret this chance of cooperation. 

Yours sincerely,

		
</p>
